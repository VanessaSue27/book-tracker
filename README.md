# Vane's Books Tracker Backend 🤓📚👩‍💻💪

For this Backend I am working with an API built with Express on Node.js. The data is stored in a Mongo Database structured with mongoose. Server deployed to Heroku and MongoDB stored in Atlas.
My main goal was to learn how to implement an image upload endpoint, this time using **Cloudinary**.

Deployed server on Heroku: https://vane-books-tracker.herokuapp.com/

## Frontend - See it in Action 💥
You can find the Books Tracker Frontend repository here, where I put this API to the test 💪: https://github.com/VanessaSue27/books-tracker-frontend

And a deployed LIVE version of it here: https://vane-books-tracker.netlify.app/
